 The fake news prediction system is an innovative technology that utilizes machine learning 
algorithms to analyze and identify misleading information in news articles. This system is designed to assist 
in combating the spread of false information on social media platforms and news websites. By predicting the 
likelihood of a news article being fake, the system can provide users with a reliable source of information 
and help them make informed decisions. The system uses various features, such as text analysis and source 
credibility, to make predictions. 

The proposed system has the potential to improve the accuracy and speed of 
fake news detection, which is crucial in today's digital age where misinformation can spread rapidly and 
have serious consequences. By identifying key features and patterns within the text, such as sources, tone, 
and factual accuracy, the system can generate accurate predictions about the veracity of news stories. This 
system has the potential to help combat the spread of misinformation and promote more accurate and 
trustworthy journalism.
